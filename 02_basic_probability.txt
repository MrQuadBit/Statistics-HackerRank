S = Sample space
a experiment is a event that can be repeated inifinitely times
P(A) = Probability of the ocurrence of an event.
P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

Two Fundamental rules of probability
P(A) is a number bewteen 0 >= P(A) <= 1 
P(S) is equals to 1
The gap between those is P(A)' = 1 - P(A)

Probability of getting an odd number when rolling a six-sided fair die
S = 6 sides = {1,2,3,4,5.6}
A = event = {1,3,5}

P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
P(A) = A / S
P(A) = 3 / 6 

Compound events:
is a combination of tho or more simple events

-Mutually Exclusive 
A and B are MuEx if they have no events in common (A ∩ B = Ø && P(A ∩ B = 0))

-Collectively Exhaustive
A and B are CoEx if their union covers all events in the sample space (A U B = S && P(A U B) = 10)

Fundamental rule
If 2 events (A and B) are disjoint, then the probability of their event is the sum of the probabilities of the 2 events.
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

If outcome of the firts events has no impact on the second event, they are considered to bw independent (tossing a fair coin)

Fundamental rule
The multiplication rule says if two events (A and B) are independent, then teh probability of both events us the producto of the probability for each event.
P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

Probability of getting 1 head and 1 tail when 2 fair coins are tossed
S = {H, T} x {H, T} = {(HH), (HT), (TH), (TT)}
A = {(H, T), (T, H)}
P(A) = A / S = 2 / 4

Let A and B be two events such that P(A) = 2/5 and P(B) = 4/5, if the probability of the ocurrence of either A or B is 3/5 find the probability of the ocurrence of both A and B together (A n B)
|A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A n B|
=> P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)
=> P(A n B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A U B)
=> P(A n B) = 2/5 + 4/5 - 3/5 = 3/5

S = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
A = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
P(A) = A / S
P(A) = 8 / 11

S = 6 * 6 = 36
A' = (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) = 6
A = S - A ' = 36 - 6 = 30
P(A) = A / S = 30 / 36 = 5/6
