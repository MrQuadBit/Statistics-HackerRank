Standar deviation
The avarage distance from the mean
how far way is every single value from the mean
SUM(abs|x_i - mean|) / N
*Absulute is used because there could be negative numbers pero algbracally its so confuse so we can use the cariance to get the standar deviation

Variance is the avarage squared distance to the mean
σ^2 = SUM(x_i - mean)^2 / N
*To regret that all the numbers getted are positives, we power to 2 o square them 

ST.DE
σ = √(SUM(x_i - mean)^2 / N)
*And then we can get the square root to the real ST.DE
